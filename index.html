	<h1>My First Responsive Website <3</h1>
	<div class="row">
		<p class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4">Your site is very simple. It consists of a page heading and 3 sections (all in one row in the desktop view). Each section contains some text. You can make it dummy text/"lorem ipsum", it doesn't matter. How the sections are laid out on the screen depends on the width of the browser window.</p>
		<p class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4">Layout: In the desktop view (992px and above), each of the 3 sections should take up equal amount of space on the screen. As you make the browser window wider or narrower, each section should become wider or narrower.</p>
		<p class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4">Layout: In the mobile view (equal to or less than 767px), each section should take up the entire row. For a visual reference of this view, see the mobile mockup illustration below.</p>
